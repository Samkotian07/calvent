Amid fears among exporters of higher tariffs in the lucrative US market from April 2 when reciprocal tariffs are set to come into effect, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry told Lok Sabha Tuesday that the government is engaging with the US to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers and improve trade.







Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal concluded his US visit last Saturday and the Ministry plans consultations with exporters this week.



Representatives from sectors including automobiles, leather, textiles, electronics and pharmaceuticals, among others, are expected to present their stance on tariff concessions that may be offered to the US during trade negotiations, The Indian Express has learnt.



Concerns over concessions grew after US President Donald Trump said last Friday that India had agreed to cut tariffs after being “exposed” for being restrictive from a trade perspective and making it difficult for American companies to do business in India. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick also said that India’s agriculture sector “must open up” for US products.
