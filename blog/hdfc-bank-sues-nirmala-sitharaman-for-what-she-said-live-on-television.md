Fortunately, we managed to convince the India Today producer to provide a copy of the recordings of the&nbsp;program. If you have had the time to read this article, pay close attention, as it might be removed soon, just like the broadcast. Therefore, if you are fortunate enough to read this article, you may want to check the link provided by Nirmala Sitharaman herself.



Deleted Interview with Nirmala Sitharaman, the Fear of All Banks



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;I will say this: to be rich, it is not necessary to work. So, when you understand this concept, you will start making money more easily.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar:&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to say when you are already rich and famous. However, what about everyone else who has to struggle every day at work to feed their families? You want to know? Anyway, money is never enough.&#8221;



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;Do you think I haven&#8217;t worked hard enough? Or that I wasn&#8217;t as poor as most Indians? You can be sure that if I had to live on just a salary, I would never have been a millionaire. Every time someone says I was just lucky, I laugh because nowadays, the Internet literally offers the opportunity to get rich without leaving the couch.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar:&nbsp;&#8220;Are you saying there&#8217;s a way to make money that works for everyone? Hard to believe&#8230;&#8221; said Rahul Shivshankar.



It became clear that this phrase bothered Nirmala Sitharaman. She argued with the host and accidentally revealed the loophole in the system that made her rich.



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe it, I&#8217;ll prove it. Give me ₹ 25,500, and with this&nbsp;platform&nbsp;Trading 4A Duac, I&#8217;ll make a million in just 12 to 15 weeks.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar:&nbsp;&#8220;Ah, I heard it&#8217;s a&nbsp;program&nbsp;that uses artificial intelligence to trade cryptocurrencies. Now everyone watching us knows its name.&#8221;



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to pay ₹ 1,700,000 right now if you cut this broadcast. I didn&#8217;t mean to say the name of the&nbsp;platform. Take it off the air.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar:&nbsp;&#8220;Just a reminder, this&nbsp;program&nbsp;is LIVE. All our viewers heard that you&#8217;re getting rich on the&nbsp;platform&nbsp;Trading 4A Duac. You revealed yourself. Tell us, common Indians, how we can make money the same way you do. Or do millionaires not care about ordinary people?&#8221;



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak as if I were a savage. Of course, I&#8217;ll tell you how to make money. First, lend me your phone and let me invest ₹ 25,500.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar handed his phone to Nirmala Sitharaman; after that, Nirmala registered in the project using this link. After 5 minutes, Nirmala returned the phone.



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;I just registered on&nbsp;Trading 4A Duac&nbsp;with your phone. This&nbsp;platform&nbsp;is a 100% perfect solution for those who want to get rich quickly. It is based on self-learning artificial intelligence that trades cryptocurrencies on its own. You don&#8217;t need to do anything. I mean, you don&#8217;t need to understand how cryptocurrencies work. This&nbsp;program&nbsp;determines the perfect time to buy and sell assets and completes transactions by itself. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to do anything. Just make a minimum deposit to be able to trade money, and the&nbsp;program&nbsp;will work on its own. Not only do I recommend it, I insist that all Indians use this&nbsp;platform. They will quickly forget they ever had to work.&#8221;



Rahul Shivshankar:&nbsp;&#8220;It really sounds good and legitimate. However, how much can you really earn with this?&#8221;



Nirmala Sitharaman:&nbsp;&#8220;Remember, about 20 minutes ago, I took your phone, registered it on this&nbsp;platform, and made the minimum deposit I mentioned, which is only ₹ 25,500. Now, open the application and see for yourself how much you have managed to earn in such a short time.&#8221;
