OnePlus is reportedly looking to expand its current OnePlus 13 series with a new
compact powerhouse â the OnePlus 13 Mini, also rumoured to be called the
OnePlus 13T or OnePlus 13T Mini. While the official name is still unclear, leaks
suggest this device could be a game-changer for fans of smaller,
high-performance phones. Especially for those who are only limited to choosing
between a Galaxy or an iPhone, in the name of a compact device â the OnePlus
13 Mini could be a breath of fresh air. The phone is expected to launch in China
by late April, with a possible India release in May.
