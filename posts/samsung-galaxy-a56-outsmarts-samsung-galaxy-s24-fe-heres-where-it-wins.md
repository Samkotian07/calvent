Check out some benefits of spending the additional money on the Galaxy S24 FE
include:

 * an Exynos 2400e processor, which is more powerful than the Exynos 1580.
 * IP68 is rated higher than IP67.
 * A little more practical 8MP telephoto camera rather than a 5MP macro unit
   makes for a superior camera configuration.
 * 8K video recording capability.
 * a better Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen as opposed to a Super AMOLED, even if on
   paper they appear to have the same brightness attributes. Additionally, their
   6.7-inch footprints are identical.
 * Samsung fans have loved the Galaxy S24 FE, as it delivers flagship-level
   performance at a reasonable price. However, in a surprising twist, the Galaxy
   A56 outshines the S24 FE in one key area. If you’re considering which device
   to buy, this factor might just influence your decision.
