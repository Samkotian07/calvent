Nehal Wadhera made an unexpected, but impactful, debut for Punjab Kings, scoring
an unbeaten 43 off 25 balls to help secure an eight-wicket victory over Lucknow
Super Giants in an Indian Premier League match in Lucknow on Tuesday (April 1).
The left-handed batter’s performance, which included three boundaries and four
sixes, was particularly noteworthy as he was informed about his selection just
moments before the game.
