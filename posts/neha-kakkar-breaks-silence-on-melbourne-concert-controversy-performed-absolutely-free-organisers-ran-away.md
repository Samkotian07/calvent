Neha shared that the sound check also got delayed because the vendor was not
paid, and that she wasn’t even aware whether the concert was happening because
the organizers stopped picking her managers’ calls. In her latest Instagram
post, Neha Kakkar broke her silence over the controversy, and wrote, “They said
she came 3 hrs late, did they even ask once that What happened to her, what did
they do to her and her band? When I spoke on stage I didn’t even tell anyone
what happened to us coz I didn’t want anyone to get harmed coz who am I to
punish anyone but now that it’s come on my name, I had to speak up. So here it
is!”

Singer Neha Kakkar has finally addressed the controversy over her Melbourne
concert, revealing what exactly happened on that day. Neha, who arrived 3 hours
late to her concert in Melbourne, faced an angry crowd, who booed her and urged
her to go back. A video of her breaking down on stage, and apologizing to the
crowd went viral. Now, Neha has revealed that the organizers ran away without
payment, and that her band wasn’t provided with basic necessities like food,
hotel, or water. She said that despite all this, they still went on stage for
the show because her fans were waiting for her.
