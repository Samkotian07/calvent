Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a prominent philanthropist, has
spent decades working with some of the brightest minds across the world.
Recently, in an engaging conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani on the podcast
Figuring Out, Gates shared his admiration for India’s incredible talent pool.
When asked to name three Indians, dead or alive, that he would like to invite

naming four individuals who left an indelible mark on him.Bill Gates, the
