Oil is Venezuela’s main export and China the largest buyer. India, Spain, Italy
and Cuba are other leading consumers of Venezuelan oil.

The “secondary tariff” 
[https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/trump-s-threat-of-secondary-tariffs-invents-new-trade-weapon-article-12974666.html]will
kick in on April 2 when reciprocal duties against the US’s trading partners,
including India, come into effect.

The tariff would be combined with any existing duties and expire a year after
the country last imported Venezuelan oil, the executive order issued by Donald
Trump on March 24 said.

The tax comes a little over a year after India resumed buying oil from the South
American country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. India
restarted imports late in 2023 after three years following the US decision to
lift sanctions on the country.

In 2024, Venezuela exported 6,60,000 barrels of crude a day, with India, China
and Spain emerging as top buyers, The Financial Times has said.
