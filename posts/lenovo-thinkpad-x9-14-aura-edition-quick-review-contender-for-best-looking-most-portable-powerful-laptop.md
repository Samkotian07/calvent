We first saw it at CES 2025. Now, the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition
admittedly, a name that could use some work is in India. It has been launched
for Rs 1,37,255, and it is unlike any other Windows laptop I’ve come across. The
market is flooded with thin and light laptops, but they all look the same and
offer the same generic features. This one, however, has potential. It is not
just another thin and light Windows laptop it feels like a machine built with
purpose.

I had a brief hands-on experience with the ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition at
Lenovo’s fourth annual Tech World event in Mumbai, and even in that short time,
it impressed me.
